var page1 = Page(pageText: "")
let page2 = Page(pageText: "After what seems like hours of exhausting hiking over several hills, a faint trickling sound reaches your ears. You hurry forward, eager to find it, as you are even thirstier than before. Suddenly, the trees part. The current is fast, but the water looks clear and feels blissfully cool when you dip your fingers in.")
let page3 = Page(pageText: "You close your eyes, spin in a circle ten times, and start walking. Unfortunately, you trip over a rock and slam face-first into a tree trunk. Now, you have a broken ankle and a deep gash on your forehead. You can feel the warm, sticky blood slowly trickling down your face.")
let page4 = Page(pageText: "The side of the road is as good a place as any for a nap. You clear the sticks and dead leaves away from the roots of a large tree. When you are done, there is a surprisingly comfortable bare patch on the ground. You curl up against the tree and close your eyes.")
let page5 = Page(pageText: "You eagerly step into the street, forgetting to check for incoming vehicles. Not two steps into the street, an incredibly shiny sports car slams into you. As you slide off the hood, you unexpectedly find yourself disappointed by the way your blood is staining the car's otherwise pristine paint... then your broken ribs register, and you start screaming.")
let page6 = Page(pageText: "The water is cool and refreshing. You drink as much as you can, but you soon notice that you are also hungry. You glance upward and spot a small cluster of spotted red mushrooms. The vibrant red colors seem a bit suspicious, but you've survived worse... right? Besides, you remember reading that some harmless plants use toxic-looking colors to scare away predators. It could be the same for fungi; the mushrooms are probably edible.")
let page7 = Page(pageText: "You wade in. The river is surprisingly shallow, and the water feels delightedly cool. You happily immerse yourself in the water, holding on to large rocks to keep from being swept away by the current. After a while, you find yourself feeling rather cold. You tiredly drag yourself out of the river, only to find some strange, jellylike blobs attached to your skin.")
let page8 = Page(pageText: "You walk until your feet are aching, but you only find yourself thirstier than before. Plus, you now have no idea where you are in relation to the river. You've gone in so many loops that you don't even know where the street is. Great going, you.")
let page9 = Page(pageText: "You flip a few rocks over. After a while, you have ammassed quite a collection of small fish, worms, and crayfish. You are faintly repulsed by their squirmy, river-dwelling nature, but you are rather hungry. Besides, you've eaten fish and lobsters raw before, in sushi. This can't be too different... you hope.")
let page10 = Page(pageText: "You gather together some spongy-looking leaves and press them against your wound, desperately hoping that they are not poisonous. The leaves soak up the blood, but now you feel lightheaded. Plus, one of the leaves stings when you touch it.")
let page11 = Page(pageText: "You start screaming loudly, though you doubt anyone passing on the noisy highway will hear you through the thick plate glass of their car windows. You don't know what you are hoping to accomplish, but the increased stress makes your blood pressure rise. Soon, the wound is bleeding even faster... and you have exhausted yourself. Your lungs feel like they are on fire, and your heart gives one last pathetic beat before your vision fades to nothingness.")
let page12 = Page(pageText: "You drift off to sleep... Suddenly, you hear the screech of tires. You open your eyes, but you only see the shiny paintjob of an incoming sports car before the vehicle - and a great deal of pain - hits you. Milliseconds later, your skull shatters when you are trapped between the off-track car and the now-decimated tree trunk. Your brain spatters over everything.")
let page13 = Page(pageText: "You open your eyes to see bright sunlight filtering through the lush green canopy above you. The night has been uneventful, and now you feel refreshed. However, you are more thirsty than you were yesterday, and you also feel slightly hungry.")
let page14 = Page(pageText: "As you are drifting off to sleep, you wonder what might happen if a car were to swerve off the road and hit your tree. Suddenly, you don't feel so tired anymore. You leap to your feet, adrenaline coursing through your veins, and sprint into the forest. Moments later, you hear the screech of tires as a shiny sports car slams into the tree, splitting the thick trunk and obliterating the comfortable spot you were in just moments before. Whew, that was a close one!")
let page15 = Page(pageText: "You lie in the street, your organs spattered across the asphalt. Just as you think you can muster the strength to crawl away, you hear the revving of the sports car that hit you. In the car is an angry-looking man with a prominent tattoo of his name - Nate. He pauses for a single moment, during which time you desperately hope it will not hurt as much as the previous collision. You are wrong - it hurts more... but nothingness follows soon after.")
let page16 = Page(pageText: "You throw caution to the wind and take a big bite. It is unexpectedly delicious, and you don't feel sick at all. You hungrily pick the rest of the mushrooms and consume them.")
let page17 = Page(pageText: "You poke around the riverbank a bit and find several plants that look vaguely edible. One of them stings your hand when you rub its leaves, so you smartly decide to get rid of it. However, the others slightly resemble a tossed salad without any dressing. Your stomach grumbles, telling you to hurry up and consume food.")
let page18 = Page(pageText: "You gulp even more water down, forcing yourself to swallow even though you don't need it. Now that you are no longer thirsty, you notice that the water tastes strange. You desperately spit out everything in your mouth, hoping that the amount you have already consumed is not toxic enough to permanently harm you.")
let page19 = Page(pageText: "You close your eyes and stuff the first leaf into your mouth. It tastes surprisingly familiar, and you suspect it is related to other vegetables that you have eaten before. Soon, you have consumed the entire collection of plants. You feel considerably less hungry now that you have eaten.")
let page20 = Page(pageText: "A wave of disgust sweeps through you, threatening to make you vomit. You chuck the handful of plants as far away as possible. There's no way you would ever eat vegetables, even if your life depended upon it! Besides, you remember hearing that humans can survive around three weeks without food. That's plenty of time to find something better to eat.")
let page21 = Page(pageText: "You approach the wreckage. The ruined sports car has tinted windows, so you must lean close and cup your hands around your eyes in order to see anything. You spot a slumped figure on the driver's side, though its features are obscured by the airbag. On the passenger side, several bundles of cash spill from a tear in a large sack.")
let page22 = Page(pageText: "You carefully walk to the side of the road and stick your thumb out in the universal hitchiker's request for a ride. Soon, an incredibly shiny sports car driven by an angry-looking person slows to a stop. One tinted window rolls down, and you get a clear glance at the man's face. His gaze is unfocused, and you think you can make out a few bottles sticking out from under the passenger seat.")
let page23 = Page(pageText: "You decide that you want nothing to do with the person who nearly squished you. You sprint the other direction as quickly as you can, hoping that the person is too injured to follow you. After all, if they almost ran you over before, what's to say they won't miss next time?")
let page24 = Page(pageText: "You approach the driver's side. The collision with the tree has twisted the frame of the sports car enough that you can pry the door open. You poke the person. He doesn't move, so you peel the airbag away from his face and drag him out of the car. As soon as you move him, blood starts seeping from under his shirt.")
let page25 = Page(pageText: "You slam a rock into the passenger side window. Tinted glass shatters easily under the blow, and you quickly stick one arm in. The driver is still unconscious, so you take your time as you attempt to drag the sack of cash out the broken window without tearing it further. As soon as the bag is free, you throw it over your shoulder and run into the forest as quickly as your feet can carry you.")
let page26 = Page(pageText: "You hop into the car, pushing a large sack of rectangular objects onto the floor. The car starts moving, and that is when you notice the many, many empty glass bottles on the floor. The driver has been drinking far too much alcohol, and he is most definitely unfit for driving right now! You can already feel the car swerving.")
let page27 = Page(pageText: "You smile uneasily at the person and step backwards, searching for a polite way to tell him you'll wait for the next driver. However, he seems a bit angry at your refusal. When you shake your head and back away again, you hear the screech of tires as the sports car turns towards you. The engine revs loudly.")
let page28 = Page(pageText: "Your mind is set: you won't eat anything but pizza. You search long and hard for a pizza shop, crossing many streams and small hills, but apparently pizza shops don't reside in forests. However, you are determined to find pizza. You push yourself to keep walking and sniffing the air for the unmistakable scent of your favorite food. Eventually, you collapse in exhaustion. With your last breath, you shout one last word: PIZZA!")
let page29 = Page(pageText: "You screech loudly and jump away from anything that moves. Even more disgust fills you. You can't possibly be expected to survive when surrounded by so many living things and - ugh - bugs! Unfortunately, your loud screaming attracts the attention of local predators. When you finally stop screeching, you notice several wolves surrounding you. They look hungry... very, very hungry... and you are their next meal!")
let page30 = Page(pageText: "You twist some vines together into a passable rope, then find a few pebbles that fit your makeshift sling. After practicing a few times, you feel reasonably confident that you can hit something. You hike through the woods, searching for dinner. When you spot an unsuspecting squirrel, you carefully take aim, whirl the sling over your head, and release the rock. It hits the squirrel, and the little tree-dweller drops to the ground.")
let page31 = Page(pageText: "You twist some harmless-looking leaves around the person's wound, hoping that they will help speed up the healing process. After a few hours, however, you are feeling extremely thirsty and the person is still unconscious.")
let page32 = Page(pageText: "You hop into the car. The controls look quite unfamiliar, but you are a quick learner. You'll get the hang of driving sooner or later. You arrange yourself in the seat the unconscious person was in, avoiding the seatbelt because it seems to have broken in the crash. The keys are in the ignition and the engine is purring, but you aren't sure how to start moving.")
let page33 = Page(pageText: "You make a pile of flammible materials, piling fast-burning tinder under a more slow-burning frame of large sticks. Once you are done, you search for a way to start the fire. Two medium-sized rocks make sparks when you smash them together, so you direct the sparks towards the tinder. Soon, you have a delightfully warm, albeit smoky, fire.")
let page34 = Page(pageText: "You walk around the woods, searching for a place to spend the night. Occasionally, you see wolf pawprints in muddy patches on the ground, but you easily avoid them. Finally, you spot a nice-looking cave. You enter cautiously, but it appears to be empty. After arranging some dry leaves and moss into a pile, you create a comfortable-looking rest area.")
let page35 = Page(pageText: "You slam your foot on the right pedal as hard as you can, hoping something will happen. Unfortunately, something happens. The car's hood may be crumpled, but its engine is perfectly functional. It lunges forward, smashing into the tree again. The airbag is already deployed and you are not wearing the seatbelt, so your head goes through the windshield and into the tree.")
let page36 = Page(pageText: "You slam your foot on the left pedal as hard as you can, hoping something will happen. However, that is the brake pedal, and nothing happens. You frown, tap it again just to be sure, and decide to try something else.")
let page37 = Page(pageText: "You inspect the strange plastic stick between the seats. There is a button on one side, so you decide to press it. Suddenly, the stick moves. It is now next to a glowing orange letter: R. The car starts rolling backwards very slowly.")
let page38 = Page(pageText: "You attempt to sleep, but you can't seem to stay still. After what seems like hours of trying - and failing - to fall asleep, you decide to get up. However, you find that you have a large stomachache, and you feel the sudden urge to expel the contents of your digestive tract.")
let page39 = Page(pageText: "You spend the next few minutes on all fours, spitting out a lumpy, sour-tasting fluid. It is extremely unpleasant, but you suppose that releasing the toxic substance is better than the alternative, whatever that may be. After a while, you collapse to the side. You are exhausted, but you feel significantly better than before.")
let page40 = Page(pageText: "Your stomach insists upon expelling its contents. However, you hold your mouth closed and force yourself to swallow air instead of releasing anything. You manage to stop yourself from vomiting... but pain quickly blossoms in your abdominal region. Your stomach has ruptured. You are losing blood rapidly, and the world soon fades.")
let page41 = Page(pageText: "You tug experimentally at one blob. It releases with a loud pop, and a thin trickle of red escapes from the spot it recently occupied. Frowning, you set to work removing the others from your body. However, you start feeling very lightheaded once all of the blobs are removed. Plus, the red puddle at your feet is getting larger by the second. Your world spins, and you fall over - first to your knees, then flat on your face. Everything fades to darkness.")
let page42 = Page(pageText: "You close your eyes and doze off. However, you are plagued by strange dreams of being eaten by wild creatures. You wake up, their gaping maws still vivid in your memory, and roll over... only to spot sharp teeth just inches away from your head. A huge, hungry-looking wolf stands in front of the cave entrance, blocking your escape route. Before you can move far, its massive jaws close around your neck, snapping your spine and ending you.")
let page43 = Page(pageText: "...car crash, you smash")
let page44 = Page(pageText: "...land on pavement, splat")
let page45 = Page(pageText: "You run the other way as quickly as possible, hoping that you will not be caught. Soon, your efforts pay off; when you pause to catch your breath, you can hear nothing behind you. It seems that you have finally escaped! However, you are tired now, and the sun is setting.")

let page49 = Page(pageText: "The car keeps moving backward, bouncing a little as the rear tires hit the side of the road. Suddenly, you hear a person's panicked screaming. Something smashes into the back end of the sports car, and the world starts spinning. When you come to, you are slumped against the steering wheel, thankfully unharmed. However, a strange hissing noise draws your attention. Smoke pours from somewhere under the hood. Before you realize what is happening, the gas tank cracks... *Kaboom!*")

He lunges at you, a switchblade flipping open in one hand. Before you realize what is happening, there is a six-inch long blade sticking out from between your ribs. You collapse to the ground, gasping. So this... this is how he repaid you for trying to help him? Maybe you would have been better off just leaving him there.")

You quickly swat it away, fighting the overpowering urge to scratch every inch of exposed skin. You seem to be having an allergic reaction; the bites are swelling up, and you are already having trouble breathing.")

let page63 = Page(pageText: "You can feel it wiggling in your mouth! Eww. Being in the woods, feeling the wiggling sensation in your mouth, tasting the river critters... it's all too much for you. Your eyes roll up, and you keel over, unconscious. Unfortunately, there is a rock on the ground, and your head impacts it.")
